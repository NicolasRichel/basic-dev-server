# Basic Development Server

This project aims at providing a very (very (very)) basic development server with
minimal configuration and maximum ease of use in order to make the setup of a
simple develpoment environment deadly fast and easy.

The project is built with the Express framework and is intended to be modular and
adaptable.

## Installation

To use this dev server you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
installed on your machine.  
Then clone this repository in the directory of your choice and launch : `npm install`
in that directory.  
To run the server : `node run start`, the server should now be up on localhost and
listening on port `8081` (default).  
**Note :** you can change the port on which the server will be listening by changing
the value of the `port` constant in `server.js`.

## Usage
